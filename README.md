Lide is a lightweight text editor written in Lua. A fork from the [lite](https://github.com/rxi/lite) by rxi.
Lide has (or will have) IDE features, like `goto definition`, `spy references` and other things like that.

## Overview
This repository is just a personal project of how I use the editor and what changes I found necessary for **my** use.<br/>
Consequently, most pull requests and issues I may miss because they are outside my main focus with it.

## Building
This program only supports Linux building because I'm a Linux user, but if you are really interested<br/>
in using it you can copy the windows libs from the parent repository and then build it using the .bat file found there too.
